# Person of Interest Ratings

Person of Interest has been a criminally under-viewed show by the public, but I believe that same lack of hype allowed the showrunners to get better every year and in their final season, they took it to an entirely different level...unlike other recent mega-budget shows. This repo contains the material used for plotting the IMDb Person of Interest ratings.

All credit goes to [u/dozzinale](https://www.reddit.com/user/dozzinale/) for the idea. Plot code is the Jupyter notebook `plot.ipynb`.
